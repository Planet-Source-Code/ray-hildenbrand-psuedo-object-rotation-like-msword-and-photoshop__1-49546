### Description

This code shows how to simply allow a user to interactively rotate an image in the manner that applications like MS word and adobe photoshop do (sort of).

' This code takes in to consideration three main concepts provided by other authors and

' extends their concepts together, namely

'  Steve McMahon Vbaccelerator.com - His code for DIB Processing and Region Mapping is superb fast and without his site, many of us would still be stuck on our first application! Thanks Steve

'  Zubuyer kaolin - His PsCode example on rotation (dial i believe) was used for most of the rotation logic, but was modified to handle the rotation point differently (top right as opposed to the center)

'  Florian Egal - His excellent library found on PSCode is the best! If you do not have this file (FoxCBmp3.dl is included in the zip) you will need to do a search on planetsourcecode for florian egal or advanced graphics 3.3 on copy the file to your sys32 directory.

'' If any one else sees any code that I did not mark as being theirs, please let me know and i will be happy to add their name.

''''Note, this code is not optimized....and is also a very small part of a much bigger project

'''' so there is a lot of code in here that is not really needed for the sake of this example, but i am not ripping it out to due time restrictions

'''' regardless, I though this was kinda neat so i thought i would share it with th vb community.

'''' Obviously, there needs some work on the rotation logic, as it is a little quirky but , you know.....
